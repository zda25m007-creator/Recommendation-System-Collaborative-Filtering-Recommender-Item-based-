✨ Why This Project?

Building recommender systems from scratch to deeply understand data structures, algorithms, and system design — without hiding behind ML libraries.

This project implements an Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) engine using core programming constructs such as hash tables, graphs, and priority queues.
The emphasis is on algorithmic clarity, sparse data handling, and performance-aware d
